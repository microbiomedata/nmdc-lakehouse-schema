"""Compare two generated flat schemas and report what changed between them.

The point of giving the flat schema a version is being able to answer "what changed in the
lakehouse and why", and a version nobody can diff answers nothing. Three committed revisions of
the artifact all declared 11.23.0 while differing in content, so until now no such report was
possible even in principle.

Reads two rendered artifacts. It does not reach the network or the installed package, so it can
compare a release against any revision materialised from git.
